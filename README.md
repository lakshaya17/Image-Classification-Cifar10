# ImageClassificationCifar

## This assignment was done as a part for course Applied Artificial Intelligence

### Steps include:

1. Use the following source: keras.datasets.cifar10
2. Try different number of neurons (efficient code requires low computational cost (less number of neurons with higher accuracy)),
3. You should be capable of accessing the NN weights and biases
4. Try different types of optimizers
5. Plot the training loss, training accuracy, validation loss, and validation accuracy,

6. Implement an EarlyStopping and save the model at a checkpoint (similar to Problem 1),
   - to implement EarlyStopping and save model at a checkpoint when
     - no progress has been acheived and/or
     - overfitting has been observed.
7. Save the model.
8. Restore the model,
9. Add more metrics that can be helpful to the customer/reader.
